   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

`extract_model`
===============

Use `extract_model` to read select output from model output files by time and/or space. Output will be selected using `xarray` by a combination of interpolation and index selection. Horizontal interpolation is accomplished using `xESMF` and time interpolation is done with `xarray`'s native 1D interpolation. Currently vertical interpolation is only possible using `xarray`'s 1D interpolation too and is not set up to interpolate in 4D as would be required for ROMS output if not simply selecting the surface layer.
